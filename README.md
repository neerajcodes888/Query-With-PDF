## Description
Query With PDFs is a Python-based web application that enables users to upload PDF files, ask questions related to the content of the PDFs, and obtain answers along with key points extracted from the documents. The application leverages state-of-the-art language understanding models to process user queries and extract meaningful information from the uploaded PDF files.

## Features
- **PDF Upload:** Users can easily upload PDF files through the user-friendly interface.
- **Question Asking:** Users can ask questions in natural language about the content of the uploaded PDFs.
- **Key Points Extraction:** The application automatically extracts key points and relevant information from the PDFs to provide concise summaries.
- **Answer Generation:** Using advanced language understanding models, the application generates accurate answers to user questions based on the content of the uploaded PDFs.

## Technology Stack
- **Python 3.8:** The primary programming language used for development.
- **Streamlit 1.0:** Streamlit is utilized as the web application framework to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.
